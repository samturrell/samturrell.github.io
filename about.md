Hi there, I'm Sam Turrell, a Frontend web developer based in York, UK. I currently craft high quality bespoke products for (Netsells)[https://netsells.co.uk].

I'm always interested in getting involved in the Open Source community, and have contributed to a number of projects already.
 
To find out a bit more about me, and about this blog in general, check out my first [Blog Post](/2017/04/30/welcome-to-the-blog/).
