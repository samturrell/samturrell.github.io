Hi there, I'm Sam Turrell, a Frontend web developer based in Scarborough, UK. I currently craft high quality bespoke products for Netsells, a digital agency based in York, UK.

I'm always interested in getting involved in the Open Source community, and have contributed to a number of projects already.
